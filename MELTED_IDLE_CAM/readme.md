Hello!



This is a simple server script that disables the idle cam for all players.

I do not offer support for this script. 

This is a standalone script that works on esx and qbcore. I have not tested it on other scripts. 

Please do not leak or reupload this script.

Download the script form your fivem keymaster.

Put inside your resources folder

Depending on how your resourcesfolder is set up, you may need to go inside you server.cfg and add the following line

thats all

Start your server and enjoy!
